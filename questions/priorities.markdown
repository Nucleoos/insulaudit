Following is from a discussion with the FDA responding to
the need to discuss what patients might do with access to
data and who is considered an "authorized user" of data.

So Medtronic makes a copy of the data from where it
originates and still resides in me and transfers it to a
location under their control.  After this step Medtronic
can give me a copy of their data or not, this is besides
the point because they've already tainted it's therapeutic
value, and I still need access to the data that still
resides in me on my device.  Any copy of their analysis
that they provide to me is not subject to review for
accuracy in a way that is entirely new with insulin pumps
and similar devices sold by Medtronic.  The method used to
transfer the data, the remote communication protocol,
consists of data which is not proprietary and contains my
medical records.  They might claim that methods to decode
and encode or communicate it are "proprietary" and may
have patents to back up their claim.  However these are
shallow claims, like attempts to patent use of a cookie in
a web form.  I haven't given them permission to transfer
data out of my control, they took the opportunity my
vulnerability brings.

Wording nits aside, I'm not sure why they would consider
the data secret or why they would not feel the need to
inform patients on how their device is intervening for
their health.  This is a chilling vision of secrecy.  My
mother happens to know how to program as well, I hope she
is not denied like I am from accessing the fundamental
controls to my health the way we used to with manual
devices.

I think the desire to retain as much control over data as
possible in order to shape the market in their favor is
reasonable and clear, but irrelevant in the face of
needing to get my own data.  Data is not proprietary,
methods are.  I'll stipulate that there is an algorithm to
decode/encode the data and that a prose description of it
needs to be placed in the user manual so that my access is
restored to the normal levels of empirical experience.
However the independent access I would gain would falls
under the sphere of influences Medtronic would seek
control over, so for them to say I'm an unauthorized user
is an obvious choice so that only they can exploit it.

There is a well established record of companies opening
details to technical problems and challenges to wide
groups with great commercial success (Google, Apple,
Netflix, Amazon, are several that come to mind
immediately, but there are myriad similar stories.), but
the current behavior appears from my end to be less
collaborative, which is why I've approached the FDA and
will also engage the EFF and other organizations that may
help.

I also understand that if the only voice an organization
has heard from for years is the vendor's, then I can
understand how another voice might present some confusing
issues initially.  Having the same business associate who
sold you the device also analyze it for safety is like the
fox guarding the hen house.  Pumps and ICD's already have
the technical capabilities needed for independent and safe
use, they are simply untapped at the intervention of
Medtronic's software and my lack of access to their
controls and logs.
