Does the usb stick expect an initialization sequence?
It looks like sending repeated status commands can wedge the usb stick?

How to send messages?

03 Status? - Does this mean different things?

WRITE RADIO COMMAND
read response from stick
ACK 03 STATUS to find RF BYTES?
  * several times?
WRITE READ RADIO COMMAND
READ until done?



Is there


initSerial
initComStation
initDevic
