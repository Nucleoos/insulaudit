This python package provides a toolkit for dealing with data used and
created by a "modern," circa 2010, insulin therapy regimen.

We provide a command line text based tool to audit
therapeutic data from a variety of medical devices widely
used.

Target Devices
--------------
  * Medtronic Minimed Paradigm Series insulin pumps
    using the usbstick

    * observed working with a 522

  * Lifescan Glucose Meters:

    * Onetouch series
    * Mini/Profile

Using the USB Stick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lifescan
________
Nothing special, my system registers a serial device right
away.

Minimed
_______
In linux, you need to poke the usbserial module with some
parameters to make it work.  This only needs to be done
once::
  
  sudo modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0a21 product=0x8001
  # or
  sudo ./reset.sh
  # which runs ./remove.sh and ./insert.sh, the latter of which does the modprobe.

On mac, I can't recall if this is necessary.  We just need
a generic usb-serial adapter.  I haven't tried it, but I
suspect COM1 will likely work on MS, although
auto-scanning will not detect it.  If your mac inserts the
device somewhere under /dev/usb.serial* we will likely
scan it.

In dmesg, you should see a message like this when you
inser the usb stick::
  
  [201197.513266] usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
  [201197.919110] usb 2-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
  [201205.729621] usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial
  [201205.730808] USB Serial support registered for generic
  [201205.731143] usbcore: registered new interface driver usbserial_generic
  [201205.731145] usbserial: USB Serial Driver core
  [201205.806220] USB Serial support registered for pl2303
  [201205.806248] pl2303 2-1:1.0: pl2303 converter detected
  [201208.305166] usb 2-1: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
  [201208.305187] usbcore: registered new interface driver pl2303
  [201208.305189] pl2303: Prolific PL2303 USB to serial adaptor driver

Installing insulaudit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no release of insulaudit, only somewhat broken
pieces of code towards establishing a tool.
:::
   
  # Download the source
  # https://github.com/bewest/insulaudit
  # or fork it on github
  git clone http://github.com/bewest/insulaudit.git
  # install insulaudit in your python runtime so you can
  # hack on it from here
  python setup.py develop


How to run
~~~~~~~~~~
The commands using PYTHONPATH assume you are in the root
directory of the repo.
The commands using insulaudit assume you have installed
insulaudit on your system (including the develop version).

Uses port scanning feature to test if we are able to
talk to a pump.  Exchange a few bytes, nothing more::
   
  # fails
  PYTHONPATH=src/ python -m insulaudit.main -v clmm   hello
  insulaudit -v clmm hello

Specifying a port seems to work.  If it doesn't, retry a
few times. ::
  
  # using the subcommand stuff:::
  PYTHONPATH=src/ python -m insulaudit.main -v clmm --port /dev/ttyUSB0  hello
  insulaudit -v clmm --port /dev/ttyUSB0 hello
  
  # run the protocol exercise directly
  PYTHONPATH=src/ python src/insulaudit/devices/clmm/proto.py /dev/ttyUSB0
  python -m insulaudit.devices.clmm.proto.py /dev/ttyUSB0


TODO
~~~~
Now that the basic framework is taking shape, the protocol
support needs to be stabilized and the framework needs to
continue to gel a bit.  I need a reliable protocol, but
there is a but demonstrated earlier that prevents very
clean and repeatable runs.  It is likely a timing issue
due to the use of select underneath the hood of pyserial.

I'm missing a serial cable for the lifescan meters.  I had
several at one point, and now cannot find any.  In
addition, the manufacturer seems to have sold out
temporarily, although some sellers will part with them for
more than double the usual price, usbstick is the best bet
for now.

  * pyserial in git
  * stabilize runs of both proto.py and hello
  * convert hello to some kind of scan
  * introduce new device flows
  * introduce device profiles/console flows
  * record logs
  * review logs
  * audit logs

    * merge logs
    * search
    * reformat

cli tool insulaudit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * init - set up a config, from default
  * checkPort/scan - scan for a port/device
  * device

    * profile
    * log 


clmm pump comms - coms.msc
__________________________
Message sizes are always in 64 byte chunks, except
outgoing messages.
Use the radio command to send a
message. Generally write each command twice.
This is kind of a "send command" command.

  read           |<------|      3 bytes [ 0x01, 0x85 U, ?? ] == success
                 |       |              [ 0x01, 0x85 f, ?? ] == fail
  write          |------>|      code=[ 0x03 ] usb status command
  repeat         |       |<     Continually ask for the usb status until
                 |       |      the stick indicates that we are done receiving and we
                 |       |      have a length.
  read           |<------|      length = bytes[6..8]
  read           |<------|      tx.stats = bytes[5]
  format         |<      |      Then use the length to format the flush 
                 |       |      command, which will give us the
                 |       |      contents of radio buffer.
  write          |------>|      command [ 0x0C, 0x00, 0x00, HighByte(length),
                 |       |                HighByte(length), LowByte(length)  ]
  read           |<------|      read data in 64 byte chunks until we've got
                 |       |      the amount of data we expected
                 |       |
