Message sizes are always in 64 byte chunks, except
outgoing messages.
Use the radio command to send a
message. Generally write each command twice.
This is kind of a "send command" command.
write          |------>|      Hint: code is 14th byte (bytes[13])
read           |<------|      3 bytes [ 0x01, 0x85 U, ?? ] == success
               |       |              [ 0x01, 0x85 f, ?? ] == fail
write          |------>|      code=[ 0x03 ] usb status command
repeat         |       |<     Continually ask for the usb status until
               |       |      the stick indicates that we are done receiving and we
               |       |      have a length.
read           |<------|      length = bytes[6..8]
read           |<------|      tx.stats = bytes[5]
format         |<      |      Then use the length to format the flush 
               |       |      command, which will give us the
               |       |      contents of radio buffer.
write          |------>|      command [ 0x0C, 0x00, 0x00, HighByte(length),
               |       |                HighByte(length), LowByte(length)  ]
read           |<------|      read data in 64 byte chunks until we've got
               |       |      the amount of data we expected
               |       |
