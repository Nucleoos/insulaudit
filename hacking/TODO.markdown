Let us know, eg on the wiki?  Mailing list?  Where do you want your data sent?

I (`~bewest`) would like a git based personal health control record, so that I
can audit and reject any thing I don't like that is also unreasonable.

## For now, we'll likely focus on in-browser experience.

We'll execute protocol directly from javascript, create some graphs, and then
offer to submit/download the data anywhere user chooses.
